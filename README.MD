## ðŸ“– DESCRIPTION

### ðŸŽ¯ What is it about?

A Front-end portfolio that will allow me to showcase my projects.

## ðŸ’» USAGE

[**>> Visit my portfolio website <<**](https://senseilein.github.io/challenge1-portfolio/)

### ðŸ’¬ User story
```
As a Front-End Developer,  
I WANT to have a portfolio webpage
SO THAT I can showcase my technical skills to potential collaborators
```
```
GIVEN the portfolio webpage

WHEN the page is loaded, 
THEN the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and my contact details

WHEN one of the links in the navigation is clicked  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN viewing the section about my work
THEN the section contains titled images of my applications

WHEN presented with the first application
THEN that application's image is larger in size than the others

WHEN images of the applications are clicked   
THEN the user is taken to that deployed application

WHEN the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices
THEN the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

```

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

It's done when:

- [ ] HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- [ ] The HTML document includes a `<meta>` description with a `viewport` and `content` attributes.
- [ ] The HTML document contains a header with a navigation menu.  
- [ ] All the links in the navigation menu have an `href`attribute with a value equals to the corresponding section's id.
- [ ] All images for each application are clickable and contain a descriptive `alt` attribute.
- [ ] All links function correctly.
- [ ] Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
- [ ] HTML and CSS files are properly commented.

## ðŸŽ¨ MOCK-UP

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

**Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing.

## ðŸ”§ TECHNOLOGY USED

- HTML
- CSS +++

### ðŸ’¡ What I've learnt

- I discovered more `<meta>` and semantics tags to improve the positioning of the web application.
- I was able to incorporate some CSS variables, providing more readability to the code.

### âž• Suggestions for improvement

- Review code colour contrast
- Make the website responsive so that it can be accessed from different platforms
